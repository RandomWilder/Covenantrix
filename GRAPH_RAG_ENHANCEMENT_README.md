# Graph RAG Enhancement Project

## 📋 Project Overview

This document outlines the strategic upgrade of the Contract RAG Manager from traditional vector-based retrieval to a hybrid Graph RAG system, specifically optimized for multilingual (Hebrew-English) contract analysis.

---

## 🎯 Current System Analysis

### ✅ Existing Strengths
- **5.5MB Vector Database** with OpenAI Ada-2 embeddings
- **Hybrid Search** (Semantic + Keyword) with smart weighting
- **Multilingual Support** (Hebrew-English) with language detection
- **Contract-Aware Chunking** averaging 1,364 characters (good size)
- **6 Contract Type Classifications** with Hebrew/English patterns
- **Previous Graph Implementation** (evidence in encrypted files)
- **Sentence Boundary Preservation** in chunking

### ⚠️ Current Limitations
- **No Cross-Document Relationship Understanding**
- **Limited Entity-Based Queries** (Who owes what to whom?)
- **No Temporal Reasoning** (contract timelines, dependencies)
- **Missing Legal Precedent Linking** (similar clauses across contracts)
- **Entity Preservation Needs Establishment** (critical for Graph RAG)
