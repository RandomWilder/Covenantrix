# OCR Service Fixes & Improvements

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes made to resolve OCR processing issues, particularly for Hebrew contracts.

## 🔧 Key Issues Fixed

### 1. **Hebrew Filename Encoding Issue** 
- **Problem**: `pdf-poppler` couldn't handle Hebrew characters in file paths on Windows
- **Solution**: Copy files with Unicode filenames to safe ASCII temp paths before processing
- **Files Modified**: `documentService.js`

### 2. **Improved OCR Detection Logic**
- **Problem**: Too restrictive scanned PDF detection 
- **Solution**: Smart detection using character density and garbled text patterns
- **Benefits**: Better recognition of scanned documents requiring OCR

### 3. **Enhanced Hebrew Language Support**
- **Added**: Hebrew legal terms recognition (`הסכם`, `חוזה`, `צד`, etc.)
- **Added**: Complete Hebrew punctuation support (`׃`, `״`, `׳`)
- **Added**: Improved language detection with character percentage analysis

### 4. **Smart Page-by-Page OCR**
- **Problem**: Processing all PDF pages uniformly
- **Solution**: Quick page analysis to skip blank/minimal content pages
- **Benefits**: Faster processing, fewer API calls, better accuracy

### 5. **IPC Handler Serialization Fix**
- **Problem**: "Object could not be cloned" errors in OCR settings
- **Solution**: Return only serializable properties from OCR info

### 6. **OCR Connectivity Test Tool**
- **Added**: Test button in settings to verify Google Vision API connection
- **Features**: Shows project ID, supported languages, connection status

## 🚀 How to Test the Fixes

### Quick Test
1. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   node test_ocr_fixes.js
   ```

### Manual Testing
1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test OCR Connection**:
   - Click the ⚙️ Settings button
   - Find "🔍 Test OCR Connection" button
   - Click to verify Google Vision API connectivity

3. **Upload Hebrew Contract**:
   - Try your Hebrew PDF contract again
   - Monitor console for detailed processing logs

## 📋 Expected Console Output

When processing a Hebrew document successfully, you should see:

```
🔄 Processing document: [Hebrew filename] (ID: [uuid])
📄 File type: .pdf, Size: [size] bytes
🔤 Unicode characters detected in file path, creating safe copy...
📁 Working with safe file path: doc_[uuid].pdf
📊 PDF Analysis: 0.0 chars/page, scanned: true
🔍 Detected scanned PDF. Attempting Google Vision OCR...
📄 Processing PDF with smart OCR: [filename]
🔄 Converting PDF pages to high-quality images...
✅ Converted [n] PDF pages in [time]ms

🔤 Language detection: Hebrew 78.2%, Arabic 0.0%, Latin 21.8%
✅ Page 1: [chars] chars, confidence: [%]%
✅ Smart PDF OCR completed: [chars] characters from [n]/[n] pages
🔤 Hebrew processing: Successfully handled Hebrew content
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If OCR Still Fails:

1. **Check Google Vision API Setup**:
   - Verify service account JSON file is correctly configured
   - Test connection using the new test button

2. **File Path Issues**:
   - Try renaming files to ASCII characters as workaround
   - Check temp directory permissions

3. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Look for specific error messages in console
   - Check processing steps in document metadata

4. **PDF Issues**:
   - Ensure PDF isn't password protected
   - Try with a simpler test PDF first

### Common Error Messages:

- `Illegal byte sequence` → Fixed by Unicode filename handling
- `No text could be extracted` → Check if OCR service is initialized
- `Object could not be cloned` → Fixed by IPC serialization improvements

## 📁 Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `documentService.js` | Hebrew filename handling, smart OCR detection, enhanced logging |
| `ocrService.js` | Page-by-page processing, connection testing, improved language detection |
| `main.js` | Fixed IPC handlers, added test connection endpoint |
| `app.html` | Added OCR test button and UI |
| `preload.js` | Added test connection API binding |

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test with your Hebrew contract** - it should now process successfully
2. **Monitor processing performance** - should be faster with smart page detection  
3. **Use the test button** regularly to verify OCR connectivity
4. **Report any remaining issues** with detailed console logs

The OCR service is now robust and specifically optimized for Hebrew contract processing! 🎉
